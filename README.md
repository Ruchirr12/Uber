### Introduction
The Uber project is an analysis of Uber trip data in New York City. The data contains information about the date and time of each trip, the latitude and longitude coordinates of the pickup location, and the base code of the driver. The purpose of this project is to analyze the data and visualize it to gain insights into the patterns and trends of Uber usage in the city.

### Data Analysis
The first step in the project was to load and preprocess the data. This involved cleaning the data by removing any missing values and converting the date and time columns to datetime format. We also extracted additional features from the date and time column such as day of the week, hour of the day, and month of the year to facilitate further analysis.

Next, we explored the data by visualizing the pickup locations on a map using the latitude and longitude coordinates. We used the folium library to create an interactive map that allowed us to zoom in and out and see the distribution of pickups across the city. We also created heatmaps to visualize the density of pickups in different areas of the city.

We then analyzed the temporal patterns of Uber usage by plotting the number of trips over time. We observed that there was a spike in usage during peak hours on weekdays and a decrease in usage during weekends. We also noticed seasonal trends in the data, with higher usage during the summer months and lower usage during the winter months.

Finally, we analyzed the data by base code to see if there were any differences in usage patterns between different Uber bases. We observed that certain bases had higher usage during certain times of the day or days of the week, suggesting that there may be differences in the types of trips that different bases are used for.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Uber project provided insights into the patterns and trends of Uber usage in New York City. We were able to visualize the pickup locations, analyze the temporal patterns, and explore differences in usage patterns between different Uber bases. This information could be useful for Uber to optimize its services and improve its efficiency in the city.
